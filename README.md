# Team-Generator

![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/AndreGitHub-MIT-green.svg)

The goal is to create a Team Generator with Node.js. It asks your Manager's name, ID, email address and Office number. Then it'll ask you if you want to add an Inter, an Engineer or Finish building your team,  rendering a index.html file with showing the employees that we're added in cards showing their credentials. Enjoy! 😀
